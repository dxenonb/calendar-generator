Calendar generator

In vanilla JS because I don't ever want to think about this again.

Only prints to US Letter right now.

# Running

Needs to be hosted from something, because I used JS modules:

```
npx http-server .
```

# Customizing

Edit main.js default config. Will refactor at some point to make it better.

# Printing

Disable "print header and footer." Set Margins to "none" (they are built in the page). Scale 100.
